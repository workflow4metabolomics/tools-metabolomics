Metabolic flux estimation
-------------------------

`influx_si` can be used for metabolic flux estimation based on labeling data from MS and/or NMR measurements. `influx_s` is used for stationary labeling and `influx_i` for instationary one (hence the '_s' and '_i' in the names). Tha name `influx_si` is used as common for both tools.

The input for `influx_si` in one or several MTF (Multiple Text Files) collections, each describing a given labeling experiment and options to use during estimation.

The output is a zip archive with files generated by `influx_si`. Among the most important are files ending with `.sim` (as 'simulated') which contains information about estimated parameters, their SD and so on.
If, in your .opt file, you have requested plotting information, it can be found in respective .pdf file.
