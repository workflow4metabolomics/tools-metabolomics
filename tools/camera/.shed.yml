    description: '[Metabolomics][W4M][LC-MS] CAMERA R Package - Annotation - Returns annotation results (isotope peaks, adducts and fragments)'
    long_description: |
      Wrapper skript for automatic annotation of isotope peaks, adducts and
      fragments for a (grouped) xcmsSet xs. The function returns an xsAnnotate
      object.

    description: '[Metabolomics][W4M][LC-MS] CAMERA R Package - Annotation - combinexsAnnos Check CAMERA ion species annotation due to matching with opposite ion mode'
    long_description: |
      This function check annotations of ion species with the help of a sample
      from opposite ion mode. As first step it searches for pseudospectra from
      the positive and the negative sample within a retention time window. For
      every result the m/z differences between both samples are matched against
      specific rules, which are combinations from pos. and neg. ion species. As
      example M+H and M-H with a m/z difference of 2.014552. If two ions matches
      such a difference, the ion annotations are changed (previous annotation is
      wrong), confirmed or added. Returns the peaklist from one ion mode with
      recalculated annotations.

    long_description: |
      Group peaks based on their retention time and intensity correlations across samples,
      identifying peaks likely to originate from the same compound. This helps enhance feature annotation
      and identification in LC-MS data.
